I'd be assist with configuration, explaination, or whatever else is needed

# Usage

1. You can start using the app by going to [breeding.chipy.dev](https://breeding.chipy.dev) and signing in with your Discord. 
2. Then click your name in the top right and go to your profile and make sure to select which "guild" or Discord server you are from. (If you don't select the right guild your Tribe breeders won't see your requests)
